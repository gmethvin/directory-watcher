/**
 * A function to convert a Path to a hash code used to check if the file content is changed. This is
 * called by DirectoryWatcher after checking that the path exists and is not a directory. Therefore
 * this hasher can generally assume that those two things are true.
 *
 * <p>By default, this hasher may throw an IOException, which will be treated as a `null` hash by
 * the watcher, meaning the associated event will be ignored. If you want to handle that exception
 * you can catch/rethrow it.
